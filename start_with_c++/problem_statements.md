## Problem statements

### Problem 1:

Let's define a sphere lying in a 3D Cartesian coordinate space. Following are the some important points defined for the sphere -
1. *Point A* - this is the origin of the sphere.
2. *Point B* - this is a point on the surface of the sphere
3. *Point O* - this is the origin.

The following are the tasks -

- **Task 1**- To find the radius of the sphere

- **Task 2** - Is the sphere lying at the origin ? How to find out if this yes or no ?

  Hint: This can be found out by calculating the distance between the centre of the sphere and the origin.

  * Find out the distance of the sphere from the origin of the coordinate space
  * Can you think some other ways in which it can be done without calculating the distance ? Can you write a program to incorporate such a logic if you have found one ? (I guess this is pretty evident !!)

**Given** : coordinates of A = (2,3,5), coordinates of B = (1,5,6), coordinates of O = (0,0,0)

Possible outcomes -

* To learn about arrays in C++
* To understand how to use arrays as calling parameters in a C++ program
