## Problem statements

### Problem 1:

Defining variables is an important part of writing a c++ program. For the following cases, can you construct a meaningful and valid variable ?

1. Let's take your age for an example. Define a variable to store your age. What can you  say for your choice of datatype of this variable ?

2. Create a variable to store the sex of a person.

3. Suppose someone wants to vote in a upcoming election. Let's assume that you are a valid voter. Can you store this information as a c++ variable ? *Hint:* You need to use a Boolean variable.

4. Create a variable to store today's temperature.

5. Radius of earth is 6400 km. Can you create two variables to store earth's radius in m and km ?

6. Console output is an important part of writing a C++ program. Can you write a statement in C++ to output the following message -

   ```bash
   I am learning C++
   ```

### Problem 2:

Let's define a sphere lying in a 3D Cartesian coordinate space. Following are the some important points defined for the sphere -
1. *Point A* - this is the origin of the sphere.
2. *Point B* - this is a point on the surface of the sphere
3. *Point O* - this is the origin.

The following are the tasks -

- **Task 1**- To find the radius of the sphere

- **Task 2** - Is the sphere lying at the origin ? How will you determine this fact ?

  (Hint - This can be found out by calculating the distance between the point and the origin)

- **Task 3** - Can you write a function that can calculate the distance between two coordinates points ?

* **Task 4** - Can you think some other ways in which it can be done without calculating the distance ? Can you write a program to incorporate such a logic if you have found one ? (I guess this is pretty evident !!)

**Given** : coordinates of A = (2,3,5), coordinates of B = (1,5,6), coordinates of O = (0,0,0)

Possible outcomes -

* To learn about arrays in C++
* To understand how to use arrays as calling parameters in a C++ function
